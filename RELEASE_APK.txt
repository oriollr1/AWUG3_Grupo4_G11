#USAGE! 
# 1. Replace <AndroidKeyName> with the filename of the keyfile generated (see url)
# 2. Replace <ProjectName> with the project name in the generated file form cordova, see path/to/my/project/platforms/android/bin and look for an APK if you need help
# 3. Replace <AndroidKeyNameAlias> from the alias used when generating the key (see url again!)
# 4. Edit path/to/my/project/platforms/android/AndroidManifest.xml and change "debuggable=false" (search for it!)
# 5. Check path/to/my/project/Release/android for your sparkling new apk!
#
# This worked and was uploadable to the google play store.
